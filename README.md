**Kalita** is text-to-speech software with a special focus on data minimisation and protection. We do not collect any personal data, do not set tracking cookies and do not outsource our service to third-party cloud solutions. The speech synthesis takes place on-premises on your own server and still offers all the convenience of a conventional readspeaker.

- [**kalita-server**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-server) is a server written in Java that provides the speech synthesis.
- [**kalita-js**](https://github.com/azmke/kalita-js) is a JavaScript client for integration into a website that provides a graphical user interface.
